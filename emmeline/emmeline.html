        <h2>Early Life</h2> <!-- background on Panhurst's life -->
        <p id="eleven">Emmeline Goulden was born July 14, 1858 in Manchester, England. She grew up, a daughter of 10, in a politically active family. Her parents were both involved abolitionsists and supporters of suffrage. As the oldest, Goulden had developed her leadership skills and passion for women's rights from an early age. She attended her first women's suffrage meeting at age 14, ultimately beginning her career as a suffragette. In 1878, Goulden met <a href ="https://spartacus-educational.com/TUpankhurst.htm">Dr. Richard Pankhurst</a>, and the two got married in 1879. Throughout her marriage, Pankhurst received consistent support from her husband in regards to her political involvement. Along with caring for 5 children, Pankhurst was determined to stay active in politics in assisting her husband in his campaigns for a position in Parliament.

        <h2>The Fight for Women's Suffrage</h2> <!-- efforts carried out for women's rights -->
        <p id="twelve">The majority of Emmeline Pankhurst's political activism began after her husband's death in 1898. In 1903, she founded the Women's Social and Political Union <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Womens-Social-and-Political-Union">(WSPU)</a>, an exclusive women's organization. The radical group, with their slogan <i><b>"Deeds, not words"</b></i> used militant tactics to express their desire for change in women's rights. When suffrage failed to advance, extremist actions would increase, eventually leading to Pankhurst's (and other group members) arrest in 1908. With the outbreak of WWI, Pankhurst brought the group's radical demonstrations to an end and strived to support the war cause. In response to female wartime involvement, Britain passed the Representation of the People Act in 1918, granting limited suffrage for women. Later that year, separate bill was passed allowing females to be elected in Parliament. Although Pankhurst did not live to see it, Britain's Parliament finally passed a bill for equal voting rights on July 2, 1928.</p>
